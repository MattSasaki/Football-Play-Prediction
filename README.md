In this workbook, we utilize a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict whether an NFL team will run or pass on a given play. We base our analysis on a play by play dataset featuring detailing every play from the past seven NFL seasons. Our models ended with test accuracies of around 74%, which is significant compared to the baseline accuracy of 58% derived from predicting a pass on every play.
